                            <p>As post title says, I wanted to know if there was a guide out there or if suggestions could be made for my laptop's specific hardware. Would it be stable or compatible with OSX. Currently running Linux Mint 19 Cinnamon 4.15.0-43-generic. Below are the more specific hardware details of this laptop: System: Host: ToshibaSatelliteP755 Kernel: 4.15.0-43-generic x86\_64 bits: 64 gcc: 7.3.0 Desktop: Cinnamon 3.8.9 (Gtk 3.22.30-1ubuntu1) dm: lightdm Distro: Linux Mint 19 Tara Machine: Device. I have a mid-2011 Mac mini which I've fitted with an SSD and 16GB RAM. It is in perfectly good condition hardware-wise, but obviously Apple doesn't consider it good enough to run macOS Mojave. I've been using MX Linux the last few months and I'm really liking it. I want to make the move to using MX Linux full time. Only issue I have is with abnormally high CPU temps at idle and it goes as high as 90C with just light use. After having tried several distros (MX 17.1, Debian stretch, Ubuntu 18.04. So this lappy is old and out of warranty, but wondered if there were any fixes around (BIOS? driver? hardware?) If I pair up my Motorola S305 headphones with the lappy, it works fine but the wifi basically dies - drops to 1Mbps from the normal 18Mbps - and it's stutters. The headphones work fine on my android devices (using the same router and channels for the wifi). I tried different wifi channels but it doesn't help. This is with fedora-28 Gnu/Linux. I tried the original Windows 7 partiti. I installed lutris and wine following the instructions on these two sites wine (https://wiki.winehq.org/Download) lutris (https://lutris.net/downloads/) But after installing and running I get this screen while "downloading files" -gt image (https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/411615726739390464/500385924878958602/unknown.png) I tried waiting for it to download even in this sate but it doesn't work. I've also tried running the game multiple times and it does download im getting a error in my oculus service log and im having trouble wrapping my brain around it here's a snippet of the log currently on 390.77 drivers trying to figure out what the issue is but cant seem to find this error anywere on the web 08/02 12:16:00.419 {!ERROR!} NVDirectDisplay NVDirectDisplayFrameNotifier::GetWaitableHandle: NvAPI_D3D_UpdatePeriodicFrameNotification error.

So for a while my PC has been having issues with crashing. What usually happens is i will be playing a game and watching youtube or twitch all the sudden my sound will cut out, then sometimes if i dont restart the computer it will either lock up and i have to hard restart or it will blue screen. it will also sometimes happen if i have a lot of things going on like alot of programs open. but it does not happen if i am just watching youtube or twitch and on reddit or working in autodesk inventor. I tried changing the gamma and the color profile. Nothing worked, my "gpu" is an integrated HD Graphics from Intel. ==================================================== System: Host: Element Kernel: 4.4.0-116-generic x86_64 (64 bit gcc: 5.4.0) Desktop: Gnome (Gtk 3.18.9-1ubuntu3.3) Distro: elementary 0.4.1 loki Machine: System: SAMSUNG product: 530U3BI/530U4BI/530U4BH v: 0.1 Mobo: SAMSUNG model: 530U3BI/530U4BI/530U4BH v: FAB1 Bios: Phoenix v: 13XK date: 03/28/201. Ive run into and issue with sound running 9front on my t520i. The soundcard shows up at boot and it finds two codecs, but when i go to play any sound i get nothing. It uses the same Intel HD 6 Series/C200 Series as the t420s (8086:1c20). Does anybody know if i need a driver of if a regression has occured in 9front? Thanks. Audio does not work in a game I'm playing which requires OpenAL. My system is an old Intel i3 on an ASUS motherboard.

At first i tried using the copy-paste mode from the HeidiH0 document on Google Drive, but after rebooting, as soon as it leaves the GRUB menu and automatically choosing the new kernel, it just locks up. I manually reboot and go back to use 4.10.17. I uninstalled the kernel, tried to install then from UKUU, but i get the same problem. I noticed both times that i get various warnings regarding dkms, i tried to do a crude reinstall. Yes it's weird! Couple of reasons to remove nouveau - I thought it might be the thing preventing me running wayland and 2) I use the intel onboard VGA and not the stupid optiplex (I don't game - why did I buy a lappy with optiplex? just ignorance and haste, really). So I scoured the interwebs and did the blacklist in grub and dracut thing. When I rebooted, the fan was full on and powertop showed the webcam running at 100% power (11W!!) It also got hot. So I instantly Hello everybody, I am absolutley new to linux and Ive just installed all the applications I need including steam. However, it doesnt seem to open!?

Hello /r/techsupport ! A few months ago I realized that half of my 16gb ram was not visible in the system. It has worked flawlessly before, I don't know what caused it to break. I decided to do a clean install of Windows 7 (64 bit) to try and fix it. Didn't work, and now my second GPU isn't detected either. Both GPU's spin up when i boot, but only one is detected. The RAM ( are two sets of 2x4gb sticks. Yes, they are not the same modes, but they worked One of our pc's is getting this error when playing some games and it's been happening since the day we got the new video card. The games it has done it with is Dragon Age Inquisition and Second Life. Also today Archeage kept crashing, but without any errors and the fps was horrible (not reaching above 20fps). This pc has a different card then the other one we have, but the same memory and also new. We're not sure what is causing this error. Also, if it helps I have acer 5755-9401. 1x3.0, 2x2.0 USB ports. Upgraded with clean install to Win10, all drivers updated and installed from official acer support site, apart from those that arrived from windows update. I have a SanDisk Ultra 128GB USB3.0 drive. Twist is, whenever this drive is connected to 3.0 port, WiFi gets disconnected. Doesn't matter what network.Only this particular drive seems to be the culprit, for any other USB drives, even other SanDisc Ultras don't cause this. Even this particular. 
I've upgraded two computers at my house to Windows 10. Both have had much different results. My Windows 8 laptop upgraded easily and operates nicely with the update. My much faster Desktop went from Windows 7 to Windows 10 and is now super laggy and has been a horrible update. I upgraded both with existing (meaning I didn't do a full wipe and install.but the laptop had nearly nothing on it to begin with). So I have been trying to figure out what my real problems were with the update Status: UNRESOLVED Computer Type: Laptop, HP Pavilion dv6-6c06tx Entertainment Notebook PC GPU: unsure CPU: unsure Motherboard:unsure RAM: unsure PSU: unsure Operating System amp Version: Windows 7 64 GPU Drivers: unsure Chipset Drivers: unsure Background Applications: unsure Description of Problem: display drivers not working Troubleshooting: tried downloading the display drivers recommended by hp but this causes black screen after restart.(sp55092).
